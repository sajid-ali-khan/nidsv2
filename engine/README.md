# Anomaly based NIDS
A Machine Learning approach for detecting Network attacks.

## Tools used
1. **Python**: Obvious.
2. **Scapy**: For sniffing the network packets.
3. **CICFlowMeter**: To create the feature vectors out of the packets, that we'll give as input to the model.
4. **CICIDS2017**: A IPS/IDS dataset for training the model.
5. **Random Forest**: ML Technique for training the model.
